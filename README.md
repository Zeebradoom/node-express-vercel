Visualize your top songs of this month, last 6 months, and of all time!

How to set up locally:
git clone https://github.com/Zeebradoom/node-express-vercel.git
go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login and create an account.
Click create an app, if prompted click to allow access to top songs/artists.
When you are in the dashboard, click Edit Settings, then white list https:/localhost:3000/callback
Also update the client_id and client_secret in the code (in index.js)

Then npm i
npm run

Should work : )

Here what it should look like:
